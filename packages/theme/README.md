> The Liquidrainbowpony Design System Theme Library

## Usage

The Liquidrainbowpony Design System uses theming to theme the liquidrainbowpony.com site and components that build the site. We export the theme as a standalone package to make the theme modular and allow usage outside of just components.

## Getting Started

1. run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. import the theme components as needed.
3. Done!
